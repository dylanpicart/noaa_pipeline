Overall structure:

NOAA, Buoy, Satellite APIs
            |
            v
Apache Spark (Managed by YARN)
- Spark extracts data from APIs.
- Writes raw data to HDFS.
            |
            v
Raw Data in HDFS (distributed storage)
            |
            v
Apache Spark (Managed by YARN)
- Loads raw data from HDFS.
- Performs preprocessing, alignment, aggregation.
- Writes final dataset to HDFS in efficient format (e.g., Parquet).
            |
            v
Aggregated Dataset (Parquet on HDFS)
            |
            v
Apache Spark (YARN-managed job)
- Reads aggregated Parquet files.
- Writes structured data into PostgreSQL (final, queryable store).
            |
            v
PostgreSQL Database
- Structured and accessible aggregated data.
- Ideal for querying, visualization, analytics, and PINN modeling.
